âœ… Objective:
To model a UML Use Case Diagram and document use case scenarios for the Inventory Management System, showcasing interactions between users and the system.

ðŸ”§ What is a Use Case Diagram?

A Use Case Diagram is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that shows:

Actors (users/external systems)
Use Cases (system functionalities)
Relationships (how users interact with functionalities)
It helps in understanding the functional scope of the project.

ðŸ§© Key Actors in the System:
Shopkeeper â€“ Manages stock and views recommendations.
Customer â€“ Places orders and checks availability.
Admin â€“ Manages users and oversees system operations.
ML Engine (System Actor) â€“ Processes data for prediction.
âœ… Use Cases:
Upload Sales & Inventory Data
Forecast Product Demand
Segment Customers
Generate Restocking Suggestions
Place Order
View Product Availability
Monitor Inventory System
Update System Configuration
