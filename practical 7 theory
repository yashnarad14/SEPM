âœ… Aim:
To understand and model a Sequence Diagram for an inventory management system using the concepts of objects, lifelines, messages, and interactions between components.

ðŸ“Œ What is a Sequence Diagram?
A Sequence Diagram is a type of UML diagram that shows how objects interact in a particular time sequence. It focuses on the order of messages exchanged between system components (objects) to carry out a function or process.

ðŸ§© Elements in Sequence Diagrams
Objects (Participants):
Represented at the top of the diagram.
Example: Customer, Shopkeeper, Inventory System, ML Engine, Database
Lifeline Bars:
Vertical dashed lines from each object.
Represent the object's presence over time.
Activation Bars:
Narrow rectangles on lifelines.
Represent the time an object is active or performing a task.
Messages:
Arrows that show communication between objects.
Types: Synchronous (solid arrow), Asynchronous (open arrow), Return (dashed arrow).
ðŸ›’ Use Case Modeled: "Inventory Restock Suggestion Flow"
Actors:

Shopkeeper
Inventory System
ML Engine
Inventory Database
Flow:

Shopkeeper uploads sales and stock data.
Inventory System receives data and passes it to ML Engine.
ML Engine processes and forecasts demand.
Inventory System fetches inventory records.
Based on prediction, system recommends restocking quantities.
Recommendation is sent back to Shopkeeper.
