Modelling DFD and CFD for Inventory Management System
1. Introduction

In this assignment, we model the Data Flow Diagram (DFD) and Control Flow Diagram (CFD) for an inventory management system driven by machine learning and predictive analytics. This system helps optimize stock readiness by analyzing historical data, customer behavior, and shopkeeper patterns.

üîÑ Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) visually represents the flow of data within the system, showing how data moves from input to processing and output stages. It focuses on what data flows, where it flows, and how it is stored.

üîÅ Control Flow Diagram (CFD)

A Control Flow Diagram (CFD) shows how control passes through various parts of the system. Unlike DFDs, which focus on data, CFD focuses on conditions, decision logic, and control statements.

Steps in the Control Flow:
Start
Login Check ‚Äì Is the user an Admin, Customer, or Shopkeeper?
If Admin:
Monitor system reports
Update inventory models
If Shopkeeper:
Upload stock and sales data
Receive restocking recommendations
If Customer:
View available products
Make purchases
System runs ML Models:
Forecast demand
Segment customers
Generate insights
End
