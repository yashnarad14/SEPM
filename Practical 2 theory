✅ What is the COCOMO Model?
The COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model) is a software cost estimation model developed by Barry Boehm. It helps estimate the effort, cost, and time required to develop a software project based on the size of the project (usually measured in KLOC — thousands of lines of code).

🧩 Types of COCOMO Models:
Basic COCOMO – Estimates effort and time based on project size only.
Intermediate COCOMO – Includes cost drivers like hardware, personnel, and complexity.
Detailed COCOMO – Adds more granularity with phases and modules.
🧠 Formulas Used in Basic COCOMO:
Effort (E) = a × (KLOC)^b → in person-months
Development Time (TDEV) = c × (Effort)^d → in months
Where a, b, c, d depend on the project type:

Organic (simple projects, small teams)
Semi-Detached (moderately complex projects)
Embedded (complex, real-time systems)
🧪 Applying COCOMO to Your Project
Project Title: Data-Driven Inventory Management System using Machine Learning
Type of Project: Semi-Detached
(Moderate complexity, academic team, multiple components like data collection, ML model, prediction module)

🔢 Assumed Inputs:

Estimated Lines of Code (LOC): 8,000 LOC (i.e. 8 KLOC)
Project Type: Semi-Detached
COCOMO coefficients:
a = 3.0, b = 1.12
c = 2.5, d = 0.35
📈 Estimation:

Effort (E) = 3.0 × (8)^1.12 ≈ 28.9 person-months
Development Time (TDEV) = 2.5 × (28.9)^0.35 ≈ 8.3 months

📝 Interpretation:
According to the COCOMO model, your inventory management project would require approximately 29 person-months of effort and 8.3 months of development time for a small team of 2–3 people. However, since it is an academic project, some phases (like documentation, marketing, testing) may be lightweight or skipped, making actual time lower.
